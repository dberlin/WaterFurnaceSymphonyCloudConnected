<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project is mainly meant as example code for how to create a Crestron Home Platform driver
that works with a cloud service (Waterfurnace Symphony in this case), and instantiates individual Extension devices
for devices that the cloud service says exist.
The devices have a UI and do something real

There is basically no real sample code that does anything available for either Extension Devices, *or* Platform drivers,
so i created this one.

I do actually use it with my heat pumps.
